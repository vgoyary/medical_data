"Per TCA with 3 NADH and 1 FADH2, generates how many ATP-","Ans. is 'b' i.e., 9 o One N ADH produces 2.5 ATP and one FADH2 produces 1.5 ATP. Thus 3 NADH and 1 FADH2 will produce 9 ATP.o There is production of ATP at substrate level also. Thus total 10 ATP molecules are produced per cycle.Energetics of TCA cycles iKreb's cycle)o One turn of the TCA cycle, starting with acetyl CoA produces 10 ATPs. When the starting molecule is pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yields 2[?]5 ATPs and therefore, 12[?]5 ATPs are produced when starting compound is pyruvate. Since, two molecules of pyruvate enter the TCA cycle when glucose is metabolized (glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate), the number of ATPs is doubled. Therefore, 25 ATP molecules, per glucose molecule, are produced when pyruvate enters the TCA cycle,o Note : Previously calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH generates 2 ATPs. This will amount a net generation of 30 ATP molecules in TCA per molecule glucose and total 38 molecules from starting. Recent experiments shoiv that these values are overestimates and NADH produces 2[?]5 ATPs and FADH produces T5 ATPs. Therefore, net generation during TCA is 25 ATPs and complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle yield a net 32 ATPs.o Energy yield (number of ATP generated) per moleeule of glucose wrhen it is completely oxidized through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle, under aerobic conditions, is as follows :- Method ofATP formationNo of ATPs gained perglucose (new calculation)No of ATPs As per old calculationPathwayStepEnzymeSource Glycolysis1 Hexokinase.Minus 1Minus 1Do3Pbosphofructoki nase-Minus 1Minus 1Do5Glyceraldehyde-3-p DHNADHRespiratory chain2-5x2 = 53x2=6Do61,3-BPG kinaseATPSubstrate level1x2= 21x2=2Do9Pyruvate kinaseATPSubstrate level1x2= 21x2=2Pyruvate to-PyruvateNADHRespiratory chain2-5x2= 53x2=6Acetyl CoA Dehydrogenase TCA cycle3Isocitrate DHNADHRespiratory chain2-5x2= 53x2=6Do4Alpha keto giutarate DHNADHRespiratory chain2-5x2= 53x2=6Do5Succinate thiokinaseGTPSubstrate level1x2= 21x2=2Do6Succictnate DHFADH2Respiratory chain1-5x2= 32x2=4Do8Malate DHNADHRespiratory chain2-5x2= 53 x 2= 6Net generation in glycolytic pathway 9 minus 2=710 minus 2=8Generation in pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction=5 =6Generation in citric acid cycle=20 =24Net generation of ATP from one glucose mole=32 =38",2,6,9,12,15,Biochemistry,Kerbs Cycle,23bbeaa8-bf60-4ab5-a9cb-270f7941006e,single,2

Ammonia in brain is trapped by -,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Glutamine o Ammonia is produced in most of the tissues. However, it should be transported to liver as urea cycle (formation of urea) occurs only in liver. Since free ammonia is highly toxic, it is never transported in free form in bloodo Two mechanisms are available for transport of ammonia from the peripheral tissues to the liver.1) In the form of glutamine# In many tissues like liver, kidney and brain, ammonia combines with glutamate to yield glutamine, by the action of glutamine synthase. The brain is a rich source of glutamine synthase and it predominantly detoxifies ammonia by this route.# Glutamine is a nontoxic major transport form of ammonia. The glutamine is transported by blood to liver where deamination (removal of amino group) of glutamine takes place. Glutaminase cleaves glutamine to yield glutamate and free ammonia (ammonium ion). The ammonia is converted by liver to urea.GlutamineH2O-------------GlutaminaseGlutamate + NH4# Formation and secretion ammonia by renal tubular cells maintain acid base balance. Ammonia is formed from glutamine by glutaminase. Excretion of ammonia increases in metabolic acidosis and decreases in metabolic alkalosis.2) In the form of alanine# Alanine transports ammonia from muscles to liver through 'glucose-alanine cycle'.# In muscle, glutamate is formed from ammonia and a-ketoglutarate by reversal of the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction. L-glutamate then transfers its a-amino group to pyruvate by transmination reaction to form alanine.# Alanine is transported to liver. In liver alanine is converted to pyruvate and glutamate by transamination reaction. Glutamate undergoes oxidative deamination to release free ammonia, which is converted to urea.

Which of the following trace elements is important for conversion of procollagen to collagen -,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Cu o Lysyl oxidase is involved in stabilization of collagen cross-linking, wrhen tropocollagen molecules assemble to form collagen fibrils.o Copper is a cofactor for lysyl oxidase;Biosynthesis of collageno The collagens are synthesized and secreted by specilized cells called fibroblasts0. Following steps occur in collagen synthesisPolypeptide chain synthesisSynthesis of polypeptide chains (a-chains) of collagen occurs in ribosomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Collagen is synthesized as preprocollagen, which contains a leader or signal sequence along with main polypeptide chain.Post-translational modificationNewly synthesized collagen (polypeptide chains) undergoes extensive post-translational modification.In endoplasmic reticulum:- Signal (leader) sequence of preprocollagen directs the polypeptide chain into the lumen of RER from the ribosomes. As it enters the RER, signal sequence is enzymatically removed. Hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues occurs to form hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine. Then glycosylation of hydroxylysine0 takes place in procollagen molecule. Then, three pro-a-chains assemble together to form triple helix0, which is helped by formation of intrachain and interchain disulfide (S-S) bonds in extension peptides (propeptides), (extension peptides are additional amino acid residues (100-300) on both amino and carboxy terminals). Winding starts from carboxy terminal end. After formation of triple helix, no hydroxylation of proline or lysine and glycosylation of hydroxy lysines take place.Golgi-Apparatus:- Procollagen is then transported to golgi apparatus w'here it is packed in the secretory vesicles and then secreted out of the fibroblasts.C) Extracellular (out side the fibroblasts) :- Following secretion from the fibroblast, extracellular enzymes called procollagen aminopeptidase and procollagen carboxypeptidase remove extension peptides (propeptides) from amino-and carboxy-terminal, respectively. By removal of extension peptides, procollagen is converted to tropocollagen (mature collagen monomer). Then, these triple helical tropocollagen molecules spontaneously assemble to form collagen fibrils. These tropocollagen molecules (which have aggregated into collagen fibrils) now become extensively cross linked0 covalently to produce mature collagen fiber. These cross-linked are further stabilized by lysyl oxidase that oxidatively deaminates the amino group of same lysine and hydroxylysine residues. The tensile strength of collagen is provided by these covalent cross-links between and within triple helical units (tropocollagen).",2,Se,Cu,Zn,Mg,Biochemistry,Membrane Structure & Function,50e5dc1d-b7e6-4f17-b395-1190181ddb4f,single,2
"In urea cycle, hydrolysis of arginine forms -","Ans. is 'b' i.e., Ornithine o Arginase catalyses the formation of urea from arginine by hydrolytic cleavage of arginine to yield urea and ornithine to yield urea and ornithine.Urea cvcleo Ammonia is ultimately disposed of by formation of urea by ""Kreb's Henseleit urea cycle"" in the liverr. Urea cycle takes place both in mitochondria and cytosol. First two reactions of urea cycle occur in the mitochondria, and remaining reactions occurs in cytosolr.o Biosynthesis of urea occurs in five steps.Carbamoyl phosphate synthase-I (CPS-I), a mitochondrial enzyme, catalyzes the formation of carbamoyl phosphater by condensation of CO2 and ammonia. Two molecules of ATP are required for the reaction. CPS-I is the rate limiting enzyme of urea cycle0. It is an allosteric enzyme and allosterically activated by N-acetyl glutamater.Ornithine transcarbamoylaser catalyzes the formation of citruliine from carbamoyl phosphate and ornithiner.Arginosuccinate synthase6 catalyzes the formation of arginosuccinate from citruliine and aspartate. This reaction requires 1ATP, but 2 high energy phosphate bonds are consumed as ATP is converted to AMP + PPi. The amino group of aspartate provides one of the two nitrogen atoms that appear in urear (The other one is provided by ammonia NH4 r).Arginosuccinate lyase (arginosuccinase) catalyses the cleavage of arginosuccinate into arginine and fumarate.

After the telomers get shortened by a critical length, cell stops dividing and enters into Go phase (senscence).o However, germ cells, cancer cells and stem cells have an enzyme telomerase (telomerase activity) which prevents telomer shortening. Thus telomers are not shortened in these cells, and therefore these cells have ability to self replicate extensively.o Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase (RNA dependent DNA polymerase) and is responsible for telomer synthesis and maintaining the length of telomers (replication of end of chromosome). Thus, telomerase provide longetivity to the cells which contain this enzyme.o Telomerase is absent from most of the somatic cells and hence they suffer progressive loss of telomers and they exit the cell cycle.o Senscent cells lack telomerase so their telomers get shortened by critical length and these cells remains in Go phase.",1,Telomerase,DNA polymerase,Catalase,Peroxidase,Biochemistry,DNA Replication ,d9e64ea6-fd26-4388-9d06-357e241752bd,single,1

These viruses carry their genome in the form of ssRNA molecules. Following infection of a host cell, the viral enzyme, reverse transcriptase, uses the viral RNA as a template for the 5'- 3' synthesis of viral DMA, which then becomes integrated into host chromosomes. Reverse transcriptase activity is also seen with transposons, DNA elements that can move about the genome. In eukaryotes, such elements are transcribed to RNA, the RNA is used as a template for DNA synthesis by a reverse transcriptase encoded by the transposon, and the DNA is randomly inserted into the genome. Reverse transcriptases, then, are RNA-directed DNA polymerases.cDNA libraries: If a gene of interest is expressed at a very high level in a particular tissue, it is likely that the messenger RNA (mRNA) corresponding to that gene is also present at high concentrations in the cell. For example, reticulocyte mRNA is composed largely of molecules encoding the a-globin and b-globin chains of hemoglobin. This mRNA can be used as a template to make a complementary dsDNA (cDNA) molecule using the enzyme reverse transcriptase. The resulting cDNA is thus a double-stranded copy of mRNA. cDNA can be amplified by cloning or by the polymerase chain reaction. It can be used as a probe to locate the gene that coded for the original mRNA (or fragments of the gene) in mixtures containing many unrelated DNA fragments. If the mRNA used as a template is a mixture of many different size species, the resulting cDNA are heterogeneous. These mixtures can be cloned to form a cDNA library. Because cDNA has no interveningsequences, it can be cloned into an expression vector for the synthesis of eukaryotic proteins by bacteria . These special plasmids contain a bacterial promoter for transcription of the cDNA, and a Shine-Dalgamo sequence that allows the bacterial ribosome to initiate translation of the resulting mRNA molecule.",1,Reverse Transcriptase,DNA Polymerase Synthase,RNA Polymerase synthase,DNA Topoisomerase,Biochemistry,DNA Replication ,0ea62a68-c834-4a7a-b777-e021885e297f,single,1

Not a metabolic product of urea cycle -,"Ans. is 'c' i.e., Alanineo Biosynthesis of urea occurs in five steps.1) Carbamoyl phosphate synthase-I (CPS-I), a mitochondrial enzyme, catalyzes the formation of carbamoyl phosphate by condensation of CO2 and ammonia. Two molecules of ATP are required for the reaction. CPS-I is the rate limiting enzyme of urea cycle. It is an allosteric enzyme and allosterically activated by N-acetyl glutamate.2) Ornithine transcarbamoylase catalyzes the formation of citrulline from carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine.3) Argininosuccinate synthase catalyzes the formation of argininosuccinate from citrulline and aspartate. This reaction requires 1ATP, but 2 high energy phosphate bonds are consumed as ATP is converted to AMP + PPi. The amino group of aspartate provides one of the two nitrogen atoms that appear in urea (The other one is provided by ammonia NH4).4) Argininosuccinate lyase (argininosuccinase) catalyses the cleavage of argininosuccinate into arginine and fumarate. Fumarate enters in TCA cycle.5) Arginase catalyses the formation of urea from arginine by hydrolytic cleavage of arginine to yield urea and ornithine. Ornithine is thus regenerated and can enter mitochondria to initiate another round of the urea cycle.",3,Citrulline,Ornithine,Alanine,Arginine,Biochemistry,Urea Cycle and Disorders,80a89f1a-5218-4f76-ae48-c7ad2037c3d7,single,3

In this phase, cell number is doubled.o The duration of cell cycle and its stages varies greatly between cell types. The time taken for S, G2 and M phases are similar for most cell types, occupying about 6, 4 and 2 hours respectively whereas the duration of G1 shows cosiderable variation as short as 2 hours in rapidly dividing cells i.e. embryonic tissue or longer than 12 hours in some adult tissue. G1 phase is most variable because, in this phase cell are not committed to DNA replication, can enter resting state or progress to next cell division.o In mammals because of the time required for a cell to progress of S-phase through mitosis from begining is typically 12-24 hours irrespective of duration of G1 phase; almost all the variation in proliferating rates are attributable to the amount of time spent in G1/Go state.",1,G0-G1-S-G2-M,G0-G1-G2-S-M,G0-M-G2-S-G1,G0-G1-S-M-G2,Biochemistry,DNA Replication ,c1a795b6-ccea-42c0-b7cf-ce26d9afad2e,single,1

Receptor mediated endocytosis is by,"Ans is A i.e. Clathrin EndocytosisThe process by which cells take up large molecules is called endocytosis.Endocytotic vesicles are generated when segments of the plasma membrane invaginate, enclosing a minute volume of extracellular fluid and its contents. The vesicle then pinches off as the fusion of plasma membranes seals the neck of the vesicle at the original site of invagination.* There are two general types of endocytosis:PhagocytosisPinocytosisPha2ocvtosisinvolves ingestion of large particles such as viruses, bacteria, cells or debris.Phagocytosis occurs only in specialized cells such as macrophages and granulocytes.PinocytosisIt is a property of all cellsIt is cellular uptake of fluid and fluid contents.Pinocytosis is of two types :Fluid phase pinocytosis - is a non-selective process in which the uptake of a solute is simply proportionate to its concentration in the surrounding extracellular fluid:Absorptive pinocytosis: is a receptor mediated selective process primarily responsible for the uptake of macromolecules. The vesicles formed during absorptive pinocytosis are derived from invagination (pits) that are coated on the cytoplasmic side with a filamentous material. In many systems, clathrin is the filamentous material.

Number of ATPs formed per cycle of TCA -,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., 10o Every turn of TCA cycle produces -i) 10 A TPs - If starting meterial is considered acetyl CoAii) 12 5 ATPs - It starting material is considered pyruvate.Energetics of TCA cycleso One turn of the TCA cycle, starting with acetyl CoA produces 10 ATPs. When the starting molecule is pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yields 2.5 ATPs and therefore, 12.5 ATPs are produced when starting compound is pyruvate. Since, two molecules of pyruvate enter the TCA cycle when glucose is metabolized (glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate), the number of ATPs is doubled. Therefore, 25 ATP molecules, per glucose molecule, are produced when pyruvate enters the TCA cycleo Note: Previously calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH generates 2 ATPs. This will amount a net generation of 30 ATP molecules in TCA per molecule glucose and total 38 molecules from starting. Recent experiments show that these values are overestimates and NADH produces 2.5 ATPs and FADH produces 1.5 ATPs. Therefore, net generation during TCA is 25 ATPs and complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle yield a net 32 ATPs.o Energy yield (number of ATP generated) per molecule of glucose when it is completely oxidized through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle, under aerobic conditions, is as followsPathwayStep EnzymeSourceMethod of ATP formationNo of ATPs gained perglucose (new calculation)No of ATPs As per old calculationGlycolysis1 Hexokinase_ Minus 1Minus1Do3 Phosphofructokinase- Minus 1Minus1Do5 Glyceraldehyde-3-p DHNADHRespiratory chain2.5x2 =53x2=6Do6 1,3-BPG kinaseATPSubstrate level1x2 =21x2=2Do9 Pyruvate kinaseATPSubstrate level1 x 2 =21x2=2Pyruvate to Acetyl CoAPyruvateDehydrogenaseNADHRespiratory chain2.5 x 2 =53x2=6TCA cycle3 Isocitrate DHNADHRespiratory chain2.5 x 2 =53x2=6Do4 Alpha keto glutarate DHNADHRespiratory chain2.5 x 2 =53x2=6Do5 Succinate thiokinaseGTPSubstrate level1x2 =21x2=2Do6 Succicinate DHFADH2Respiratory chain1.5 x 2 =32x2= 4Do8 Malate DHNADHRespiratory chain2.5 x 2 =53x2= 6Net generation in glycolytic pathway9 minus 2=7 10 minus 2 = 8Generation in pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction=5= 6Generation in citric acid cycle=20= 24Net generation of ATP from one glucose mole=32= 38",1,10,24,8,30,Biochemistry,Kerbs Cycle,78e49654-ae4e-40c7-8e3c-b8e542870ac9,single,1

Carboxylases requires -,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Biotin o Biotin is a coenzyme for carbon dioxide fixation reactions.o It serves as prosthetic group of ATP-dependent carboxylase, i.e., in carboxylation reactionQ,o It acts as coenzyme tor acetyl-CoA carboxylaseQ, propionyl-CoA carboxylaseQ, pyruvate carboxylaseQ and metbylcartonyl-CoA carboxylase.",4,Vitamin B12,Folic acid,Niacin,Biotin,Biochemistry,Mechanisms of Enzyme Action,d5d5045e-5143-462e-bbd9-ff6208dddd9a,single,4
Retinitis pigmentosa patients doesn't have:-,"Not all, but many studies have found that patients with retinitis pigmentosa tend to have lower blood levels of DHA (Docosa Hexaenoic Acid, o3, 22:6), an omega -3 fatty acid found in the photoreceptor cells. ADDITIONAL READING ON DHA: Also known as Cervonic acid. This is having 22 C and 6 double bonds (Docosa means 22, Hexaenoic means 6 double bonds). These days health drinks (bournvita, horlicks) are foified with DHA, as it is impoant for the brain and retina development in infants and children. Decreased amounts lead to increase risk of Retinitis Pigmentosa. DHA is present in high concentration in sperms, retina, cerebral coex. Constant source of DHA is breast milk. Synthesized to a limited extent from a-linolenic acid or obtained directly from fish oils.",1,DHA,Eicosa pentaenoic acid,Arachidonic acid,Timnodonic acid,Biochemistry,NEET 2019,f3161ce9-6869-445f-aa2b-42a56d7a40ce,single,1
